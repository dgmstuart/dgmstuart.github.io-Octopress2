    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve always tended to write commit messages by answering the question &ldquo;What did I do?&rdquo;, but I learned a different approach recently which tends to produce much more expressive commits, which are often more terse as well. Compare the following:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> &ldquo;What did I do?&rdquo; </th>
<th> &ldquo;What do things look like now?&rdquo; </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> &ldquo;Fixed a bug whereby active links were displaying in the wrong colour&rdquo; </td>
<td> &ldquo;Active links now display as blue&rdquo; |</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> &ldquo;Changed the styling of the popup for clarity&rdquo; </td>
<td> &ldquo;The popup now more clearly displays the review description&rdquo; |</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> &ldquo;Fixed styling bug in previous commit&rdquo; </td>
<td> &ldquo;The styling added in the previous commit now only gets applied to the modal&rdquo; |</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> &ldquo;Added a list of reviewed versions with icons to the security column&rdquo; </td>
<td> &ldquo;The security column now displays a list of reviewed versions |</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Ok, so not all of these are fantastic commit messages (they&rsquo;re all real from recent work I&rsquo;ve done). This approach isn&rsquo;t a magic formula but it helps me to focus on what&rsquo;s most relevant, and I feel like the messages on the right are more useful.</p>

<p>An important insight is that although at the time the distinction between implementing a feature/fixing a bug/adding a tweak seems important, when scanning through a list of commits, it&rsquo;s probably the actual behaviour which which is going to be most useful <em>(caveat: if you have a story ID or ticket reference then it&rsquo;s probably worth including)</em>.</p>
