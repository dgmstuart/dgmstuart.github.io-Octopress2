* FP Is a bit of a buzzword right now - means different things to different people
* 3 language features:

## Strong typing
* Useful - detect a lot of errors, generate efficient code, can be useful docs

## Immutable - no side effects
* creates copies, no reassignment, same function same arguments = same results (Referential transparency)

##High-order functions
