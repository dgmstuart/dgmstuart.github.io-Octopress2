_Awesome sketchnotes by [@studionetting](http://instagram.com/p/tc-b8atkPN/)_

* Remote user testing
* Google hangouts or Skype
  * Important to make sure that your users are comfortable with the tech before officially starting the test
* Beginners or Experts as your users: depends what you're testing
* Have a 5 minute chat to screen them: make sure that they meet your profile - that they will provide useful data

* Scenarios: Start with the test (specific task that they need to do) then work it up into a scenario
* Start off with a script
* after that - relax them: get them talking by asking some simple questions:
  * "what are your favourite themes and plugins"
* Don't be afraid to just skip a step if they're struggling
* To close off the session:
  * Ask any addition questions
  * answer any questions they have
  * thank them (!!)

* Throughout: Keep a poker face
