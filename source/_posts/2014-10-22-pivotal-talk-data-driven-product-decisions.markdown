* First thing is to ask the right questions
* Book - Lean Analytics
* Articulate Assumptions about the benefits of your product,
* Define Hypothesis: how will we know (in terms of hard metrics) if our assumptions are validated? What does success look like?
* To start with, focus on one key metric
* Behavioural plan - what do you want users to do - both to achieve user needs and business needs
* You have a live product:
  * Is it meeting the hypothesis

* Product retrospectives: how are we doing with the product - what does the data tell us about how well it's going?

* Data-Driven vs Data Informed approaches
  * Data Driven:
    * Focus on one metric - collect lots of data (A/B, Multivariate tests etc. and understand whether what you're doing is impacting that metric)


* Data Informed
  * Data might not tell you whether it's a good product idea full stop: might be a leap of faith
    * When you actually have an MVP, *then* you can start gathering data
  * Plurality is the key: data is often just one aspect in data decisions
  * Talk - Adam Osiri (?) on Facebook's data-informed approach
  * Data is important, bit other factors come into play: resources, competition, regulation, brand.
  * You can't replace intuition or creative ideas with data


* 5 key points:

  1. Focus on the right questions
  2. Data can't replace intuition
  3. Listen to the data and act accordingly
      * This is hard
      * e.g. data might say that your idea or your variation isn't actually effective.
  4. Build and launch with data in mind
      * Include analytics in the user stories
      * Start thinking about your assumptions and hypotheses at the beginning of the product life cycle
      * as soon as you start working on the product you should be working with the analytics team/building data in from the ground up.
  5. Be clear about your hypotheses, sample size and timing.
      * how large a sample do you need before you can claim that your results are significant.

* Final statement "Embrace the data - don't fear it"
