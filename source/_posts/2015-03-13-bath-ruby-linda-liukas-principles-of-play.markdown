* Railsgirls in over 277(?) cities
    * Started in Helsinki
* "The most scalable change in the world happens when you're 4 years old"
* "If you draw 1000 circles eventually your circles will get better"
* Realtity distortion: being in the community allowed her to think "Hey I can
  write a children's book, even though I don't know how to draw, or write a
  book, or program very well
* 3 principles of learning: Playfulness, Curiosity, Rules
* Learning Real-world languages (Finnish) by reading other people's texts, not
  by learning grammar rules first
* "Little girls don't know the are not supposed to like computers"
* Two joys of programming: 1. Building beautiful elegant proper things 2.
  trying things which you're not sure will work and thrilling when it actually
  works. This second one is the playfulness (what she's focussing on"
* 3 components of learning: Achievement, Social and Immersion. Traditional
  learning mainly just focusses on the first
* Rules: *how* do things work. "Imposing logic on something otherwise hard to
  understand"
* Teaching through metaphors: baking cupcakes - if you change the recipe
  you'll get different cupcakes.
* Curiosity: Asking *why*
  * Introduce 5 year olds to the idea that any object (cars, dogs, toilets)
    could have a computer in it
  * Opening up to asking questions: "what _happens_ when I press play", "is
    the internet a place" - these sort of questions which many adults don't
    really
    ask
  * Making computers out of paper - totally open thinking: this button prints
    out lego - that button makes breakfast.
* __why's poignant guide etc. - opens up to this idea that people in
  programming can be whimsical, human - not what an initial picture of
  programming might be like
* Programmers have found the loophole: we are the world-builders: making
  something out of nothing using just words: Programming as Storytelling
