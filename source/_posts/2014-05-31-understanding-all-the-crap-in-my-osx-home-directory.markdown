Blog: PATH - gets set in /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d



.netrc
.serverauth.xxxx
.CFUserTextEncoding
.rnd
  A long string of random characters - looks to be the seed file used by openssl


.lesshist - Apparently whenever I open something up using less on the command line, and then search within that file, it saves those searches to a file... This can be disabled by setting an environment variable: export LESSHISTFILE="-"

----------------------------------
.rdebug_hist - history file for the ruby debugger. Not planning on using that again any time soon.

.recently-used.xbel
  Sounds like this might be related to using Pidgin back in the day: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16230/what-is-.recently-used.xbel-and-how-do-i-delete-it-for-good/



.Xauthority and .serverauth.xxxx - seem to be something to do with ssh-ing onto a remote X11 machine. Probably related to web hosting fiddling. As far as I can tell these files are deletable. Also the .serverauth files shouldn't be getting generated.

This can be fixed by going to your user/X11/bin/startx file and editing this line
xserverauthfile=$HOME/.serverauth.$$
to this:
xserverauthfile=$XAUTHORITY

CTX.DAT - something to do with Citrix sessions. I had to use Citrix in a previous job. (source: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1713980?start=0&tstart=0)

.thumbnails
  Gimp's cache of thumbnail images

.vim/

contains only one file - .netrwhist
As far as I can work out, netrw is a vim plugin allowing you to use vim to operate on directories (as well as files). I have a couple of config lines, plus one history line in there - probably a result of some mistake fiddling around with vim foo I didn't understand

.hgignore_global - The mercurial equivalent of .gitignore. When did I have a Mercurial repo on my machine???


.gem/ very old - only related to ruby 1.8. Renaming it didn't seem to have any ill effects

stuff I couldn't work out and deleted anyway:
.gtk-bookmarks - contained a couple of file paths to old website projects. Maybe something to do with GIMP

.gimp-2.4/
  Seems to be all the fonts and brushes etc. used by GIMP. Newer versions of Gimp run natively in OSX rather than in X11 - hopefully all this won't be needed. Trashing it.

.gem/specs
  Kept - as far as I can understand, when installing or updating system level gems (e.g. gem install x) the gemspecs which rubygems finds are cached here, presumably to make future installs and updates faster

-------

Legit stuff:
.dropbox/
.rvm/
  I guess this needs to live in my home directory because it's specific to me as a user? https://rvm.io/rvm/install


.heroku/
  Deleted this and it got re-created, but there seemed to be a lot of redundant stuff in there from back when heroku was a gem - e.g. console history which isn't used by the new heroku client

.viminfo seems to contain some interesting historical information
.zsh-update contains a single line "LAST_EPOCH=15952" - This is used by .oh-my-zsh to work out whether it should ask you to check for updates: it will ask if the last update was more than 6 days ago.
(source: https://bitbucket.org/Josh/oh-my-zsh/src/tip/tools/check_for_upgrade.sh)


Questionable stuff Which I left
.fontconfig/ - contains a lot of cache files http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontconfig
