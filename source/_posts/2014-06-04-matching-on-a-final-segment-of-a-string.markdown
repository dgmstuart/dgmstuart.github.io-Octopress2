When matching on the final segment of a string, e.g for a file extension, you could use a regular expression:

```ruby
> "foo.bar" =~ /.*\.bar$/
# => 0
> "foo.bar.baz" =~ /.*\.bar$/
#=> nil
```

But of course in ruby there's a much more expressive way
```ruby
> "foo.bar".end_with?(".bar")
#=> true
> "foo.bar.baz".end_with?(".bar")
#=> false
```

You can even pass multiple suffixes as arguments:

```ruby
> "foo.qux".end_with?("bar", "baz", "qux")
#=> true
```

Oh Ruby how I love you so.
