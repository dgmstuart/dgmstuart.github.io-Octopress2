    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>EDIT: Apparently it&rsquo;s not possible to run docker inside a Bowery instance
because Bowery uses docker and docker has a hard time running inside a docker
container - see <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bowery/WsXWzWghwVc">this post on the forum</a></em></p>

<p><a href="http://bowery.io/">Bowery.io</a> is a hosted development environment service.
The idea is that you edit your files locally, but run your code in a cloud-hosted
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> container, based on an image which can be
shared and edited by teams.</p>

<p>It looks like it used to host its own packages and allow environments to be
set up through a gui, but now the approach is to either install everything by
hand or use a dockerfile, which I guess makes sense as docker has become more
and more popular and Bowery&rsquo;s main audience is going to be quite devvy devs
who are comfortable using docker.</p>

<p>I had a go at setting up an environment for ruby development and didn&rsquo;t really
find any documentation so here&rsquo;s what I tried:</p>

<h2>Approach: Use a dockerfile</h2>

<p>The simplest way to start your Bowery image with ruby is to use a dockerfile
which sets ruby up for you. This can be as simple as creating a file called
<code>Dockerfile</code> at the root of your project, consisting of this line:</p>

<pre><code>from ruby:2.2.0
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;then when you select your code directory for the first time through the
Bowery app you can click &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on this prompt to initialize your Bowery image
based on that Dockerfile:</p>

<p><img src="/images/content/bowery_prompt.png"></p>

<p>More details about this approach can be found <a href="http://bowery.io/posts/dockerfile-support/">on the Bowery blog</a></p>

<h2>Approach: Install ruby directly</h2>

<p>Not having ever used docker in anger, my first attempt involved just
installing ruby manually. The following steps are
basically a textbook set of steps for installing ruby on a new Ubuntu machine
(which is what Bowery instances are based on):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Update apt-get:</p>

<pre><code> apt-get update
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/wiki#suggested-build-environment">Install the dependencies for ruby-build</a>
using apt-get</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">Install rbenv</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build">Install ruby-build</a></p></li>
<li><p>Install ruby with rbenv:</p>

<pre><code> rbenv install 2.2.0
 rbenv global 2.2.0
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Install bundler:</p>

<pre><code> gem install bundler
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<h2>What about Rails?</h2>

<p>I <em>have</em> managed to successfully set up a Rails dev environment using Bowery,
but it ended up being pretty fiddly and I&rsquo;m not sure I have anything coherent
enough to blog about.</p>

<p>I essentially set it up just like any other ubuntu box would be set up (but
I&rsquo;m still pretty green at server management - hence fiddly).</p>

<p>What I was hoping
to find was a Dockerfile which at least set up Ruby and Postgres, but it seems
like the normal approach is to run separate Docker containers and link them
(as in <a href="http://allenwei.cn/setup-rails-development-environment-with-docker/">this tutorial</a>).
I don&rsquo;t think this approach applies to Bowery, where a single dockerfile is
used to initialize the image. I suppose I could run docker on Bowery though? (#meta)</p>

<p>In any case, here are the additional components which need to be installed to
run my Rails dev environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Javascript runtime (I installed Node.js with apt-get)</li>
<li>A database (I installed Postgresql with apt-get but had a pain setting it up)</li>
<li>A headless browser for javascript specs (I <a href="http://phantomjs.org/build.html">built phantom.js from
scratch</a></li>
</ul>
