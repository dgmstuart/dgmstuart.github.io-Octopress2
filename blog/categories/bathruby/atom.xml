<ul>
<li>Dreyfus model of skill acquisition - LOOK UP</li>
<li>Advice she got for going from novice to expert: &ldquo;Read code&rdquo;</li>
<li>Codeclub: sunday morning reading group</li>
<li>Rules for what to read: Exemplary code: popular, documented, well maintained</li>
<li>Starting point: Sinatra&rsquo;s <code>get</code> method</li>
<li>&ldquo;A huge fan of remote working: Any excuse to not wear pants is great&rdquo; :)</li>
<li>Met on google hangouts</li>
<li>Did a retrospective on the sessions:

<ul>
<li>Decided to pick only small things: &lt; 100 lines of code: gives space to ask
questions, reasearch etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Understanding: it&rsquo;s not really about reading the code: it&rsquo;s about the
convesations it starts.</li>
<li>Keeping it small - 5 consistent people - helps to keep it engaged</li>
<li>Important to have a &lsquo;tour guide&rsquo; making sure everyone is engaged and
contributing (?)</li>
<li>Asking the question of crappy methods &ldquo;how would we have written it?&rdquo; is
really interesting.

<ul>
<li>Therefore it&rsquo;s not necessary for the code to be exemplary: lots of benefit
in reading shonky code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drawing out knowledge gaps: the things you think you understand but actually
have no idea about</li>
<li>Reading something you actually need to use is a totally different
experience: you&rsquo;re much more invested in it</li>
<li>Look at organisation of the code, not just the detail (how code is organised
into files, what they&rsquo;re called etc)</li>
<li>Learning on your own is possible but really tiring.</li>
<li>Learning in a bootcamp is very expensive and time-consuming</li>
<li>Solution: <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/">codenewbie</a> - connecting new developers with each other</li>
<li>&ldquo;The learning happens in the digressions&rdquo;</li>
<li>Knowledge = connecting the &lsquo;dots&rsquo; of information</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Railsgirls in over 277(?) cities

<ul>
<li>Started in Helsinki</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;The most scalable change in the world happens when you&rsquo;re 4 years old&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you draw 1000 circles eventually your circles will get better&rdquo;</li>
<li>Realtity distortion: being in the community allowed her to think &ldquo;Hey I can
write a children&rsquo;s book, even though I don&rsquo;t know how to draw, or write a
book, or program very well</li>
<li>3 principles of learning: Playfulness, Curiosity, Rules</li>
<li>Learning Real-world languages (Finnish) by reading other people&rsquo;s texts, not
by learning grammar rules first</li>
<li>&ldquo;Little girls don&rsquo;t know the are not supposed to like computers&rdquo;</li>
<li>Two joys of programming: 1. Building beautiful elegant proper things 2.
trying things which you&rsquo;re not sure will work and thrilling when it actually
works. This second one is the playfulness (what she&rsquo;s focussing on&#8221;</li>
<li>3 components of learning: Achievement, Social and Immersion. Traditional
learning mainly just focusses on the first</li>
<li>Rules: <em>how</em> do things work. &ldquo;Imposing logic on something otherwise hard to
understand&rdquo;</li>
<li>Teaching through metaphors: baking cupcakes - if you change the recipe
you&rsquo;ll get different cupcakes.</li>
<li>Curiosity: Asking <em>why</em>

<ul>
<li>Introduce 5 year olds to the idea that any object (cars, dogs, toilets)
could have a computer in it</li>
<li>Opening up to asking questions: &ldquo;what <em>happens</em> when I press play&rdquo;, &ldquo;is
the internet a place&rdquo; - these sort of questions which many adults don&rsquo;t
really
ask</li>
<li>Making computers out of paper - totally open thinking: this button prints
out lego - that button makes breakfast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>__why&rsquo;s poignant guide etc. - opens up to this idea that people in
programming can be whimsical, human - not what an initial picture of
programming might be like</li>
<li>Programmers have found the loophole: we are the world-builders: making
something out of nothing using just words: Programming as Storytelling</li>
</ul>
