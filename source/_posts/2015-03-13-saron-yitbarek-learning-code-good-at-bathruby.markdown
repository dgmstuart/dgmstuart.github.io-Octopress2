* Dreyfus model of skill acquisition - LOOK UP
* Advice she got for going from novice to expert: "Read code"
* Codeclub: sunday morning reading group
* Rules for what to read: Exemplary code: popular, documented, well maintained
* Starting point: Sinatra's `get` method
* "A huge fan of remote working: Any excuse to not wear pants is great" :)
* Met on google hangouts
* Did a retrospective on the sessions:
  * Decided to pick only small things: < 100 lines of code: gives space to ask
    questions, reasearch etc.
* Understanding: it's not really about reading the code: it's about the
  convesations it starts.
* Keeping it small - 5 consistent people - helps to keep it engaged
* Important to have a 'tour guide' making sure everyone is engaged and
  contributing (?)
* Asking the question of crappy methods "how would we have written it?" is
  really interesting.
  * Therefore it's not necessary for the code to be exemplary: lots of benefit
    in reading shonky code
* Drawing out knowledge gaps: the things you think you understand but actually
  have no idea about
* Reading something you actually need to use is a totally different
  experience: you're much more invested in it
* Look at organisation of the code, not just the detail (how code is organised
  into files, what they're called etc)
* Learning on your own is possible but really tiring.
* Learning in a bootcamp is very expensive and time-consuming
* Solution: [codenewbie](http://www.codenewbie.org/) - connecting new developers with each other
* "The learning happens in the digressions"
* Knowledge = connecting the 'dots' of information
