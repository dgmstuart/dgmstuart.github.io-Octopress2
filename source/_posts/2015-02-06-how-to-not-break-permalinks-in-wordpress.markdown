I've written a blog post for [work](https://www.dxw.com/) about how much you can and can't mess around with urls in WordPress before old links stop working. It boils down to 5 rules:

1. Editing Post slugs doesn’t break old links
2. Editing Post url structure (the permalinks) doesn’t break old links
3. Changing both the permalink structure and the slug will break old links
4. Editing the parent/child relationships of pages doesn’t break old links
5. Editing the slugs of pages will break old links
