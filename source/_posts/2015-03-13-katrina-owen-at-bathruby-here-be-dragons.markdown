* Some bugs are admirable. Squashing them makes you feel victorious
* Squashing the bug isn't enough: if you don't clear up the root issues, it
  will just cause you future pain - cleaning up the mess.
* Fundamental attribution error: assume that bad code means a bad
  person/unskilled developer (other people), or assume that they were having a bad day (our
  friends)
* Prisoner's dilemna as a metaphor for the choice of whether to follow good
  practices
  * The rational choice is to always 'defect' - but everyone loses.
  * The way to maximise the overall result for people is for everyone to
    cooperate (add tests, improve error handling, extract responsibilities)
  * only works if everyone is on board: one person 'defecting' will mess it up
    for everyone
* Every commit we make tips the balance in one direction or the other: towards
  entropy or order
